	<h2>Home</h2>
	
	<p>The good developers in the content team have came up with a way for you guys to track work, show external clients templates, layouts and components as well as keep track of campaign progress.</p>
	
	<p>We figured it would be more functional and more informative than 100 different spreadsheets, in 100 different locations. So this, can be our cenral hub for all things Boots.com</p>
	
	<h3>How does it work?</h3>
	
	<p>First of all, you need to <a href="http://evdatacenter.co.uk/boots/account/signup">sign-up</a>. Once you've signed up, your request will go to one of our developers so they can review your request.</p>
	
	<p>This is nothing to worry about, it's just for security, and so that we can monitor who's using this service.</p>
	
	<p>Some areas of this site may contain confidential information, so we need to check and double check who's signing up and why. If a user signs up with a valid boots.co.uk e-mail address, this will speed up the process.</p>
	
	<p>You may recieve and e-mail from us within 1 to 2 working days to double check.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<p><b>Once you're in</b> you can use all the features of the site by <a href="http://evdatacenter.co.uk/boots/account/login">loggin in</a>. This grants you access to certain private areas of the site, though some others are reserved for the admins for technical reasons.</p>
	
	<p>If you have any suggestions, please <a href="ewan.valentine@boots.co.uk">e-mail the admin</a></p>

	<p><b>Kind regards:</b> the content team.</p>
